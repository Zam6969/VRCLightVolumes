## LightVolumeManager
Stores the Light Volume atlas, Point Light Volume texture arrays and references to all runtime Light Volume instances. Controls and updates all shader globals used by the Light Volumes system.

### Public Fields
| Public Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`Texture3D LightVolumeAtlasBase` | Combined Texture3D containing all baked Light Volume SH data. This field is not used directly at runtime when post processors are used, see `LightVolumeAtlas` instead. |
|`Texture LightVolumeAtlas` | Combined runtime texture containing all Light Volumes' baked SH data. |
|`int CustomTexturesWidth` | Width of each runtime Point Light Volume projection texture slice. |
|`int CustomTexturesHeight` | Height of each runtime Point Light Volume projection texture slice. |
|`float LightsBrightnessCutoff` | Minimum brightness used to cull Point Light Volumes. Larger values improve performance by shrinking light range, but make attenuation less physically correct. |
|`int ShadowTexturesWidth` | Width of each runtime shadow map slice. |
|`int ShadowTexturesHeight` | Height of each runtime shadow map slice. |
|`int ShadowTextureFormat` | Precision used for EVSM shadow maps and the runtime shadow texture array. `0` = `ARGBHalf`, `1` = `ARGBFloat`. The authoring Setup component assigns this automatically from the active build target. |
|`float ShadowBleedReduction` | Global EVSM light bleeding correction. `0` disables it, `1` is strongest. Higher values can collapse soft penumbra. |
|`float ShadowMinVariance` | Raw global minimum EVSM variance used by the receiver shader. The authoring Setup component stores separate PC and Android/Quest/iOS `0..1` logarithmic sliders, but the Udon manager stores only the resolved raw value for the active build target. |
|`bool LightProbesBlending` | When enabled, areas outside Light Volumes fall back to Unity Light Probes. Otherwise, the Light Volume with the smallest weight is used as fallback. It also improves performance. |
|`bool SharpBounds` | Disables smooth blending with areas outside Light Volumes. Use it if your entire scene's play area is covered by Light Volumes. It also improves performance. |
|`bool AutoUpdateVolumes` | Automatically updates transform data for volumes marked `IsDynamic`. Enabling/disabling, `Color` and `Intensity` changes update without this option. |
|`bool AutoUpdateTextures` | Automatically updates dynamic Point Light Volume cookie, LUT, cubemap and shadow sources, such as RenderTextures or Materials. |
|`int AdditiveMaxOverdraw` | Limits the maximum number of additive Light Volumes and Point Light Volumes that can affect a single pixel. |
|`bool ForceSceneLighting` | Disables min/max brightness limits for modern avatar shaders such as lilToon or Poiyomi. Enable only if you're sure your scene lighting is properly configured. |
|`LightVolumeInstance[] LightVolumeInstances` | All registered Light Volume instances. You can enable or disable volume GameObjects at runtime. Manually disabling unnecessary volumes improves performance. |
|`PointLightVolumeInstance[] PointLightVolumeInstances` | All registered Point Light Volume instances. You can enable or disable point light GameObjects at runtime. Manually disabling unnecessary point lights improves performance. |
|`RenderTexture CustomTextures` | Runtime texture array used for Point Light Volume cubemaps, LUTs and cookies. Cubemap faces are stored first, 6 slices per cubemap. Area Light cookies use its mip chain for textured emission and old-shader average-color fallback. |
|`int CubemapsCount` | Number of cubemaps stored in `CustomTextures`. Cubemap faces start from the beginning, 6 elements per cubemap. |
|`bool HasAutoCustomTextureUpdates` | Internal state. True when at least one projection source needs per-frame texture updates. |
|`RenderTexture ShadowTextures` | Runtime texture array used for Point Light Volume shadow maps. |
|`int ShadowCubemapsCount` | Number of cubemap shadow maps stored in `ShadowTextures`. Cubemap shadow maps use 6 slices each and are stored first. |
|`int ShadowMapsCount` | Total shadow map count stored in `ShadowTextures`. Cubemap shadows use 6 array slices, single projected shadows use 1 slice. |
|`bool HasAutoShadowTextureUpdates` | Internal state. True when at least one shadow source needs per-frame texture updates. |
|`Material CubemapFaceMaterial` | Internal material used to copy cubemap faces into runtime texture arrays. You usually don't need to touch this field manually. |
|`Material CookieCropMaterial` | Internal material used to crop Area Light cookies while copying them into runtime texture arrays. You usually don't need to touch this field manually. |

### Public Properties
| Public Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`int EnabledCount` | Number of currently enabled regular Light Volumes after manager culling and sorting. |
|`int[] EnabledIDs` | Registry indices of currently enabled regular Light Volumes. This is mostly useful for advanced custom Udon integrations. |

### Public Methods
| Public Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`void NotifyLightVolumeChanged(LightVolumeInstance lightVolume, bool rebuildFinalData)` | Notifies the manager that a Light Volume instance changed. Instance methods call this automatically. Use `rebuildFinalData` when activation, ordering, additive state or atlas data requires a full rebuild. |
|`void NotifyPointLightVolumeChanged(PointLightVolumeInstance pointLightVolume, bool rebuildFinalData, bool customTexturesChanged, bool shadowTexturesChanged)` | Notifies the manager that a Point Light Volume instance changed. Use the boolean flags to rebuild point light data, projection texture caches or shadow texture caches. |
|`void InitializeLightVolume(LightVolumeInstance lightVolume)` | Registers a Light Volume instance at runtime. Called automatically by `LightVolumeInstance.Start()` / `OnEnable()` when `LightVolumeManager` is assigned, and when the manager reference is assigned later. |
|`void DeinitializeLightVolume(LightVolumeInstance lightVolume)` | Removes a Light Volume instance from the runtime registry without resizing the array. Called automatically on disable. |
|`void InitializePointLightVolume(PointLightVolumeInstance pointLightVolume)` | Registers a Point Light Volume instance at runtime. Called automatically by `PointLightVolumeInstance.Start()` / `OnEnable()` when `LightVolumeManager` is assigned, and when the manager reference is assigned later. |
|`void DeinitializePointLightVolume(PointLightVolumeInstance pointLightVolume, bool customTexturesChanged, bool shadowTexturesChanged)` | Removes a Point Light Volume instance from the runtime registry and optionally invalidates projection or shadow texture caches. Called automatically on disable. |
|`void ReinitializeCustomTextures()` | Rebuilds the shared runtime texture array for Point Light Volume LUTs, cookies and cubemaps. Call this after changing projection sources or Area Light cookie crop rectangles manually. Sources are deduplicated by source object, auto-update mode and Area Light crop rectangle, so the same source can have separate static, auto-updated or cropped slices when needed. |
|`void UpdateAutoCustomTextures()` | Updates only projection sources marked for per-frame refresh. Usually called automatically when `AutoUpdateTextures` is enabled. |
|`void ReinitializeShadowTextures()` | Rebuilds the shared runtime texture array for Point Light Volume shadow maps. Call this after changing shadow sources manually. |
|`void UpdateAutoShadowTextures()` | Updates only shadow sources marked for per-frame refresh. Usually called automatically when `AutoUpdateTextures` is enabled. |
|`void UpdatePointLightShadowTextureSlice(PointLightVolumeInstance instance, int sourceSlice)` | Copies one shadow source slice into the shared shadow texture array. Runtime shadow bakers use this when they manage their own update loop. |
|`int GetPointLightCustomID(PointLightVolumeInstance instance)` | Returns the resolved projection texture ID for a Point Light Volume instance, or `-1` if none is assigned. |
|`void RequestUpdateVolumes()` | Schedules a Light Volume data update on the next delayed update tick. Prefer this over calling `UpdateVolumes()` repeatedly. |
|`void UpdateVolumes()` | Immediately rebuilds and uploads all Light Volume and Point Light Volume shader data. Useful when you intentionally manage updates manually instead of relying on delayed requests. |

## LightVolumeInstance
Stores all runtime regular Light Volume configuration including atlas UVW data, transform data, color and intensity.

When changing a Light Volume from another Udon script, prefer the setter methods below over direct field writes. They skip unchanged values and notify the manager with the smallest required update path.

### Public Fields
| Public Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`bool IsDynamic` | Defines whether this volume can be moved in runtime. Disabling this option slightly improves performance. |
|`bool IsAdditive` | Additive volumes apply their light on top of others as an overlay. Useful for movable and togglable lights. They can also project light onto static lightmapped objects if the surface shader supports it. |
|`Color Color` | Multiplies volume color by this value. Changing the color is useful for animating Additive volumes. |
|`float Intensity` | Multiplies the volume color. Basically controls brightness. |
|`Vector4 InvLocalEdgeSmoothing` | Inversed edge smoothing in local atlas space. Recalculates via `SetSmoothBlending(float radius)`. |
|`Vector4 BoundsUvwMin0` | Min bounds of Texture0 in 3D atlas space. `w` stores atlas scale X. |
|`Vector4 BoundsUvwMin1` | Min bounds of Texture1 in 3D atlas space. `w` stores atlas scale Y. |
|`Vector4 BoundsUvwMin2` | Min bounds of Texture2 in 3D atlas space. `w` stores atlas scale Z. |
|`Quaternion InvBakedRotation` | Inverse rotation of the pose the volume was baked in. Needed for dynamic rotated volumes. |
|`Matrix4x4 InvWorldMatrix` | Inversed TRS matrix of this volume that transforms world positions into the 1x1x1 local volume cube. |
|`Vector3 RelativeRotationRow0` | Current volume rotation matrix row 0 relative to the rotation it was baked with. Mandatory for dynamic rotated volumes. |
|`Vector3 RelativeRotationRow1` | Current volume rotation matrix row 1 relative to the rotation it was baked with. Mandatory for dynamic rotated volumes. |
|`bool IsRotated` | True if there is any relative rotation. No relative rotation improves shader performance. |
|`LightVolumeManager LightVolumeManager` | Reference to the Light Volume Manager. Needed for runtime registration and updates. Assigning it after `Start()` / `OnEnable()` also registers the instance automatically. |
|`int RegistryOrder` | Current stable manager registry tie-breaker used when `RegistryWeight` values are equal. It is assigned automatically by the manager; read it for diagnostics or custom integrations, but do not set it manually. |
|`float RegistryWeight` | Current manager registry sort weight. Higher weights are selected first when active volumes exceed the shader limit. Read this field to get the current weight; use `SetWeight(float weight)` to change it so the manager can reorder the registry. |
|`bool IsActive` | Internal active state used by the manager. It becomes false when the GameObject is inactive, intensity is zero, or color is black. |

### Public Methods
| Public Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`void SetDynamic(bool isDynamic)` | Sets dynamic mode and rebuilds the manager volume list only when the value changes. |
|`void SetAdditive(bool isAdditive)` | Sets additive mode and rebuilds the manager volume list only when the value changes. |
|`void SetWeight(float weight)` | Sets runtime registry priority and reorders this volume in the manager registry only when the value changes. Higher weights are selected first before the 32-volume shader limit; equal weights keep stable registration order. Additive volumes are still compacted before regular volumes in the final shader upload. |
|`void SetColor(Color color)` | Sets volume color, updates the internal change cache and notifies the manager only when the value changes. |
|`void SetIntensity(float intensity)` | Sets volume intensity, updates the internal change cache and notifies the manager only when the value changes. |

|`void UpdateTransform()` | Recalculates `InvWorldMatrix`, `RelativeRotationRow0`, `RelativeRotationRow1` and `IsRotated`, then notifies the manager. Executes automatically from the manager for dynamic volumes when `AutoUpdateVolumes` is enabled. |

## PointLightVolumeInstance
Stores all runtime Point Light Volume configuration including light type, projection source, shadow source, transform data, color and culling range.

When changing a Point Light Volume from another Udon script, prefer the setter methods below over direct field writes. They skip unchanged values, keep internal change caches in sync and notify the manager without rebuilding unrelated texture or light data.

|`float SpotCookieAspect` | Width / height aspect used by custom Spot Light cookie projection. |
|`Vector4 AreaCookieCrop` | Normalized Area Light cookie crop rectangle. X/Y are the lower-left offset, Z/W are width and height. Use `SetAreaCookieCrop(...)` when changing it at runtime so the manager rebuilds affected texture slices. |
|`float Height` | Area light height in meters. Affects textured Area Light emission and size-aware Area Light speculars in modern compatible shaders. |
|`float SquaredRange` | Squared range after which the light is culled. Recalculated by the manager when `IsRangeDirty` is true. |

|`LightVolumeManager LightVolumeManager` | Reference to the Light Volume Manager. Needed for runtime registration and updates. Assigning it after `Start()` / `OnEnable()` also registers the instance automatically. |
|`int RegistryOrder` | Current stable manager registry tie-breaker used when `RegistryWeight` values are equal. It is assigned automatically by the manager; read it for diagnostics or custom integrations, but do not set it manually. |
|`float RegistryWeight` | Current manager registry sort weight. Higher weights are selected first when active point lights exceed the shader limit. Read this field to get the current weight; use `SetWeight(float weight)` to change it so the manager can reorder the registry. |
|`bool IsActive` | Internal active state used by the manager. It becomes false when the GameObject is inactive, intensity is zero, or color is black. |

|`float FarClip` | Far clip distance used when the EVSM shadow map is baked. `0` recalculates it from this light's current culling range and is usually the recommended default. Use a manual value only to clip distant shadow casters or reduce the shadow depth range for a known bounded area. |
|`float Blur` | Shadow blur radius applied after baking, normalized to 128x128 shadow resolution. Editor baking uses spherical shadow-space blur to reduce visible cubemap and Spot Light projection seams. Runtime baking uses `Planar Blur` unless `PointLightShadowRuntimeBaker.SphericalBlur` is enabled. `0` keeps the baked shadow map unblurred. |
|`float ContactHardening` | Hardens shadows near contact areas. Can produce artifacts, so use it carefully. More performant when set to `0` in runtime shadow mode. Runtime baker spherical mode also applies to contact hardening samples. |

### Public Methods
| Public Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`void SetDynamic(bool isDynamic)` | Sets dynamic mode and rebuilds the manager light list only when the value changes. |
|`void SetWeight(float weight)` | Sets runtime registry priority and reorders this point light volume in the manager registry only when the value changes. Higher weights are selected first before the 128-point-light shader limit; equal weights keep stable registration order. |

|`void SetIntensity(float intensity)` | Sets light source intensity, updates the internal change cache and marks range dirty only when the value changes. |
|`void SetShadingStrength(float shadingStrength)` | Sets per-surface Point Light Volume shading and shadow strength in the `0..1` range, updating the internal change cache only when the value changes. |
|`void SetShadowSettings(float shadowMapID, bool worldSpaceShadows, int layerMask, float nearClip, float farClip, float bias, float blur, float contactHardening)` | Sets shadow ID, shadow projection mode and runtime bake settings in one call. `farClip = 0` keeps the automatic culling-range based far clip. Notifies the manager only when shader-facing shadow data changes; layer mask, bias, blur and contact hardening changes are stored for runtime bakers without forcing unrelated rebuilds. |
|`void UpdateTransform()` | Updates position, rotation and scale data only when transform values changed. |
|`void UpdatePosition()` | Forces position data update and notifies the manager. |
|`void UpdateRotation()` | Forces rotation or direction data update and notifies the manager. |
|`void UpdateScale()` | Forces scale-dependent data update, recalculates area size when needed and marks range dirty. |

## PointLightShadowRuntimeBaker
Runtime Udon component from `Extra/Shadow Runtime Baker` that renders EVSM shadow maps for one **Point Light Volume Instance**. Use it when a shadow needs to update in runtime.

The hidden camera and runtime materials are prepared automatically by the editor and build preprocessor, so they are intentionally not listed here as regular user-facing fields. The `_RealtimeBakeLoop()` public event is internal to the delayed bake loop and should not be called manually.

### Public Fields
| Public Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`PointLightVolumeInstance TargetPointLightVolume` | Target point, spot or area light instance that receives the runtime-baked shadow texture. |
|`bool BakeOnEnable` | Runs one distributed bake cycle when the baker becomes active. |
|`bool Realtime` | Continuously updates shadow slices through a delayed Udon event loop. Use carefully because realtime shadow baking is expensive. |
|`int Resolution` | Resolution used by the runtime depth target and shadow texture. Matching **Light Volume Setup** `Shadow Resolution` avoids an extra copy path. |
|`int RealtimeFacesPerFrame` | Number of cubemap faces rendered per realtime bake tick. Single-slice Spot Light shadows ignore this and update one slice. |
|`int ShadowBlurSamplePreset` | Runtime blur and contact hardening sample preset. `0` = Low, `1` = Medium, `2` = High. `Planar Blur` uses 30/62/126 two-pass blur taps; `SphericalBlur` uses 33/65/129 one-pass blur taps. Lower presets are cheaper. |
|`bool SphericalBlur` | Samples runtime blur and contact hardening in spherical shadow space to reduce visible cubemap and single-slice Spot Light projection seams. More correct, but more expensive than `Planar Blur`. |

### Public Methods
| Public Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`void BakeShadows()` | Bakes all shadow slices immediately. If `Realtime` is enabled, it also starts the realtime bake loop. |
